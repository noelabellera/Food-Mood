# FOOD MOOD

## About FOOD MOOD
FOOD MOOD is a search app that searches restaurants around your local area. Sounds a lot like Yelp, right? Actually it is but with a little twist. FOOD MOOD actually returns suggested restaurants to eat at according to the weather. In essence, you'll know instantly where the soups spots are when the weather is cold, and where you can grab a nice cool salad or sushi roll when the weather gets toasty. Happy searching in your local areas.

## Unsolved Problems
1. Narrowing down search by shortening the radius of the given zip code
2. Adding more keywords to the URL query to give more results (types of food) according to the weather
3. Getting the time of the day from the weather API to change the weather icon from day to night.
4. Show favorites 

## Next Steps
* Enhance styling
* Add a message board for people to share their experiences 
* Add more features to the app and transform it to more than just a food suggestion app (music, movies)
* Suggest recipes to cook according to the weather rather than restaurants.
* Add a share button to share with friends the results incase they want to join in on the dinning experience
